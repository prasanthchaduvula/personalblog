I planned a road trip from Madurai to Dhanushkodi (the last land of India) Tamilnadu. My best friend joined in the journey. he reached Madurai where I was staying at the time of this trip. I have taken a Hero Hf Deluxe bike for rent which is 100cc bike but me only two things were there in the brain that is bike rent should be less and mileage should be more


Night 8 pm I received a bike from the vendor and went to the railway station to pick my friend who came from Hyderabad to Madurai. we stayed in Madurai for that night in a rented house where I used to stay.


First day of the ride:

we started the bike ride early morning at 5:03 AM and took the national highway to Trichy(Tiruchirappalli) which is 140 km and into the town, it's total of 165 km.
The best part of the morning ride on the highways is we can feel beautiful sunrise with clean blue sky and empty roads. no traffic nothing just feel the moment
