Its a journey of 21 year's old college dropout born in a small village in the state of Andhra Pradesh, failing from startup to reaching the Himalayas to learn how to live life. 


After launching startup minimum viable product for testing we generated a revenue of 12 lakhs within 55 days served. To make product scalable we needed technology. but the truth is I am not good at programming. so I decided to learn how to code.


That's the time, I fell in love with programming. because before, for me programming is just necessity as I was computer science engineering but now it became my habit and passion to build the products I wanted to 

Its always good to build the products you passionate about. so I landed in Himachal Pradesh to learn how to code.


I joined in coding Bootcamp Altcampus. After a week of sessions, I was able to make simple websites.


Success is not about where you come from, it's about where you are going.
Now I am finding myself in the roots of Himalayas and also building the things I am passionate about
